# Sisu
A Java programme for tracking student's progress in their studies using Sisu API. The study module data fetched from the API is presented in a JavaFX UI.

This was a group project for the Programming 3 (Interfaces & techniques) course at Tampere University in Spring 2022.

I wrote the classes Course.java, DegreeProgramme.java, DegreeSaver.java, GroupingModule.java, SisuModule.java, Specialisation.java, Student.java and StudyModule.java. The user interface (consisting of App.java and PrimaryController.java) was written by Essi Huhtanen (@essihuhtanen) and DegreeBuilder.java was written by Elisabet Dalskaja (@eliny9000).

Documentation is available in Finnish only.
